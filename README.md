Language Access 911 Simulation Dashboard
This repository contains the prototype for the Language Access 911 Simulation Dashboard, an interactive survey instrument designed to mimic the experience of a 911 call operator interface. This simulation dashboard is a custom-designed interface developed by the research team at the University of Washington, tailored to explore and improve workflows in emergency response systems.

The dashboard simulates real-time decision-making scenarios for 911 call operators, allowing researchers to:
- Evaluate call operator workflows
- Collect user interaction data

Features: 
- Interactive UI mimicking a 911 operator dashboard
- Customizable configurations for different emergency scenarios which includes custom addresses and Google Maps integration
- Audio files to play when buttons are clicked

Technologies Used: 
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Google MyMaps 
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)
